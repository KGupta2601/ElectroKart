## 4. Installation

Follow these steps to set up ElectroKart locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version >= 14.x)
- **npm** (version >= 6.x)

You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Steps to Install ElectroKart

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/ElectroKart.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd ElectroKart
```

### 3. Install the dependencies:

- For Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

- For Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node index.js
MONGO_URL = ""
email = ""
password = ""
OAUTH_CLIENTID  = ""
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET  = ""
OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN = ""
# Paste your MongoDB URL here for local testing
```

### 4. How to get Oauth Credentials

#### Step 1: Create a Project in Google Cloud Console
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Click on **Create Project**.
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "Nodemailer Setup") and click **Create**.
4. Once created, select your project from the project dropdown menu in the top-left corner.

#### Step 2: Enable Gmail API

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
2. Search for **Gmail API** in the search bar.
3. Click on **Enable** to activate the Gmail API for your project.

#### Step 3: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services > OAuth Consent Screen**.
2. Under **User Type**, choose **External** (this is the only option if you're not part of G-Suite).
3. Fill in the required fields:
    - **App Name**: Choose a name for your app.
    - **User Support Email**: Enter your email.
    - **Developer Contact Information**: Enter your email again.
4. Click **Save and Continue**.
5. On the Scopes page, click **Save and Continue** (you can skip adding scopes for now).
6. On the Test Users page, add your own email address as a test user. Click **Save and Continue**.
7. It is important to add the test users as these will actually allow to send mail from the emails you are using.

#### Step 4: Create OAuth Credentials

1. Go to the **Credentials** tab in the sidebar.
2. Click the **+ Create Credentials** button and select **OAuth Client ID**. 
3. Choose **Web Application** as the application type.
4. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, add the following URL:
```bash
https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground
```
5. Click **Create**. You will now see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save these as you will need them later.
6. Note: These will act as your Oauth_Client_Id and Oauth_Client_secret.

#### Step 5: Generate a Refresh Token

1. Go to [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground).
2. In the top-right corner, click the **Settings** icon.
3. Check the box labeled **Use your own OAuth credentials**.
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** obtained in Step 4. 
5. In the OAuth Playground, under **Select & Authorize APIs**, search for **Gmail API v1**.
6. Select the following scope:
```bash
https://mail.google.com/
```

7. Click **Authorize APIs** and sign in with your Google account.
8. After authorization, click **Exchange authorization code for tokens**.
9. Copy the **Refresh Token** from the output and paste it in OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN.


### 5.Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```
